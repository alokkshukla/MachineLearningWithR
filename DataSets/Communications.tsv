COMPLAINT	i am an imperia account holder. i had good rapport with the branch manager. i have visited the branch for some purpose (a problem your staff cannot handle) 3 times in last few weeks. its only on my questioning i was told the branch manager has been transferred else where. is it not duty of hdfc bank to notify this type of changes. moreover even after questioning the staff concerned did not feel the need to introduce me to the new branch manager. do u think i should continue banking with u or ???????

COMPLAINT	every month i?m receiving a sms stating deduction of 683/- as a non-maintenance charge (salary account) when i logged into your account to check it shows rs -2500+/- (negative balance) that was really strange for me and i never seen this in any other bank. when i left the company i called your customer care and raised a request to close the account as per the rbi circular it should be ensured that the balance in the savings account does not turn into negative balance solely on account of levy of charges for non-maintenance of minimum balancehence i request you to freeze or close my account with immediate effect.
COMPLAINT	never go for this bank ever else be ready to be looted. despite having all the necessary documents for the home loan and all other conditions being met hdfc took 1.5 months to proceed the loan and kept us waiting. we asked them to stop the proceedings as they were taking too long we were being told that a huge service charge will be deducted now as a service fee. that means for hdfc's unnecessary delay and their negligent attitude towards work the customer will be held accountable and will be monetarily punished. #shameonyouhdfc

COMPLAINT	teami'm getting calls from hdfc collection team saying my ex-colleague has taken loan from bank and he has not paid itseems. me and mr.ravi kiran addanki has worked together some 8 years back and no connection with me from last 7 years after i have moved to another company. till yesterday who ever calling me from hdfc i was telling that i dont have his contact. but yesterday one guy called me from 04449263306 and asked his contact. again i told the same that i dont have his contact at all. then he said he has my home address so he will come to my home talk to me itseems. why is this..?? when i dont have his contact how u want me to give? what is the rubbish he is talking that he will come to my and talk..??? who is the right person to escalate..?
COMPLAINT	hi bank well i am writing to express my serious disappointment on the way things have been happening with my account- despite being a salary account holder with hdfc in an mnc. now i have reached a point where i am planning to cut down on all financial relationships with hdfc here goes the story- i had a credit card which got blocked by the bank which is understandable my fault now when i started making the payment- not be delinquent in any way i requested for a change of address and phone number which never happened. i moved to bangalore from hyderabad a few days ago i get a call from some number to make the payment and i am informed that they have taken an approval and i need to send cheques to a particular address now can i base my actions on a phone call? then after 2 days i see that 45000 from my account get swiped and i am running post to pole to get answers to it. finally when my relationship manager helped me the person from hyderabad team cuts a sorry figure and tells me that though this is not how it should have been done it has been done and nothing much can be done. guys is this the way you function without a perfect sync within teams lack of communication and above and beyond this testing the patience of a honest customer who could not make the payment some time earlier being unemployed. i am sorry but this is not how the other banks work i have been with some best ones and they would always get in touch with the customer before even debiting a penny out of it. i just hope my note reaches the right person and i am called for a connect on the issue. the money is gone so is my liability i am happy but i am equally sad for the processes that you folks follow!!! you may get in touch with me on 9742222272. i cannot share my customer id here.
COMPLAINT	dear team u would like to give feedback about your hdfc bank am have 1 hdfc bank account in faridabad january onward hdfc bank deduct 687 rs per months for maintenance charge and am mail hdfc customer support mail id but no any response after 2 days amÿgive reminder than am receive rply from me nilesh mr nilesh says this is non maintenance charge am give reply this maintenance charge why not deduct before january after am not received reply am requesting to hdfc team please refund my 5 months money 687*5 =3435 and also revert on my mob 9910253100
COMPLAINT	i am writing here regarding my hdfc credit card and before you start reading the mail go through this complaint # 16158870101 as it will give you idea about the situation. you guys process is so pathetic and i cannot even dare to refer you guys to my worst enemy. changing phone number is such a painful process i am trying to do that from the last 6 months and couldn?t succeed i have sent 3 letters through indian post and 2 couriers one from bluedart and another from firstflight finally you guys acknowledged that you received the letter couriered by me through firstflight and initiated the process for the phone number updation and today when i call your customer care the answer which i received is shocking ?the application is rejected because of mismatch of my signature?. updating phone number is such a pathetic process with you guys. unfortunately i don?t remember the credit card pin number?.i don?t have the old phone number with me and the credit card is not pin enabled ?what will be the security of my card when i am unable to update the number and get transaction alerts on my phone?i want you guys to solve this issue at earliest before i lose the remaining little trust what i have on your ban
COMPLAINT	i also found very worst management last one year i am waiting for my pin no also want to update phone number many time
COMPLAINT	i have been waiting from last 6 months and i sent letter and it was rejected because of mismatch in signature...........what a crazy reason...seems like you are just looking for reasons to reject and trouble customers. why someone else will send request for change in mobile number on behalf of me?if in case signature is not match you guys can call and confirm and do authentication or you can ask me visit the nearest branch and show the docs and get things done but for that i have to send letter after letter to chennai and you guys reject it....are you guys really living in digital era?
COMPLAINT	sent mail to customerservices.cards@hdfcbank.com and codecomplianceofficer.retailassets@hdfcbank.com and posted here and tried sending many letters to you guys.
COMPLAINT	let me write my long torrid story .since i being preferred customer of hdfc bank i went one of their branches and bought a prepaid forex card for my us trip somewhere on 14th or 15th with some dollars as deposit.i was told that anybody can top up using their net banking id.the following morning i tried topping up with 500 for dollars it asked for me the dates which i promptly input following days datewhich was my journey. the net banking software refused saying that you need atleast 3 days to topup again i went the malaleswaram branch bangalore and complained they took a application and did the job saying everything be fine once you reach us. after of reaching us i tried to top up again with different dates the software said that the facility has been blocked and i need to go to third party transfer and change my question and answer however nothing worked and my credit card and debit seems to work often some establishment accepted and some machines rejected it. i had to borrow money from friends and cousin despiting having enough balance in my sb account.the story never ends here - i tried calling hdfc bangalore branch (kastraba road branch) number given in their web site. i used to get up till late night and call the phone machines ask 100's of question before putting me the forex department after 6 minutes of waiting in the q the call disconnected second time call with different number told them it was a distress call from new york and need help in fixing my top up problem they bluenty said it was different department and cut the call.i was luck 3rd time went to forex department and the lady in broken english told that the call had come to main forex and i should call bangalore forex. before that i had sent a couple of emails with screen shot as proof to credit card customer support they told me that since it belongs to forex they transfer it forex department.eventually nothing worked i was forced to use my credit card wherever accepted or borrow dollars.i lost my face in front of relatives and friends for making use of your forex card.the head of hdfc card divsion ( cc and forex card) should deserve a slap on his face as head with due respects individually.it really shocking experience such kind of lousy customer service.my miseries didn't end there as a prompt payer credit card dues i tried to clear my dues on the net banking id the software picks the ip and realizes that i was outside and ask for otp for each and every action on the net banking. its a good thing that they have a security in place i sent mail to my customer care requesting them send otp passwords to my registered email they promptly rejected . you expect people carry the same phone number abroad also? again i had requested friend to make payment on my behalf despite having balance in the account. very embarrassing.situation!!my cell number is 9480247492 from this hdfc can find out other detais like customer id and forex number lets see how this works.regardsharsha

COMPLAINT	dear hdfc i have been a loyal customer to hdfc. i am an nri customer. i would like to mention that it is so difficult to update my information in my account. for example if i lose my netbanking password then there is no email facility on the website that i can retrieve my password. the customer representative is not able to assist me properly. according to them i should write all my information on an a4 size paper 1. name 2.old phone number 3. new phone number 4. sign it and send it to nri services. then only the bank will update my information and able to retrieve my password. i would like to ask why people like us have to suffer to prove our identification in such a manner. there is no backup available properly to retrieve the password. even if over the phone i provided and answered all the necessary questions. however the process needs a week to get access my account. there is no backup available if i forget my phone number or change my phone number. kindly address this problem.

COMPLAINT	i have been a customer of icici bank for last 16 yrs. now in the past one year i have realized it is the most pathetic bank around definitely even worse than the public sector banks. due to its policy and laziness and complacency of its employees. the delhi vasant vihar branch leads in its defiant and disrespectful attitude towards its customers. deputy branch manager nitin mehrotra aman shukla and a host of others. its time the bank pulled up its employees or it will lose its customers. a simple export documents submission has not been processed since its submission on february 102016. if the bank cannot even do this small job because of which unethical charges are being deducted from our bank account every quarter then the bank should sack its staff and shut down its branch. the horrible vasant kunj branch delhi is not any good either. i have completely lost my trust in this bank! you may contact me at +919810086667.

COMPLAINT	i am disappointed with how icici has been treating me ? i have been writing to it over the last 12 years about a sum that went missing from my account and it has still not resolved it. i am attaching my latest letter to ms kiran of customer service in the hope that it might come to the attention of ceo chanda kochhar:dear kirani opened the account in person and paid us$100 in cash during a visit to india. please see the copy of the attached pay-in slip from your bank which shows the date as 13/01.04.if you go through the trail of emails in this stream you will see that your bank has taken more than nine years to look into this issue and has still not resolved it. i have been passed from officer to officer. among the latest are hafeez md jyothi bodhigala sonali preetam laxman kamble and now your good self. i am losing confidence in the bank?s willingness to deal with this issue.the crux of the problem is that although i paid us$100 in cash as shown in the pay-in slip that money was never credited into my account. all the other issues of non-activation etc are due to this. to the bank?s discredit it has never explained in writing how this happened nor apologised.i am getting old and cannot travel to india to sort out this problem. i can only hope that there are people with enough integrity in your establishment to take the trouble to verify all this and compensate me. us$100 was worth a lot more in 2004 than it?s worth today. because it was not credited into my account i have lost whatever interest it would have accrued over the last 12 years to your bank?s coffers. whether the sum is $1 million or $100 your bank should have the integrity to resolve this issue. i am posting this letter on your bank?s facebook page in the hope that your ceo chanda kochhar might notice it and do something about it.regardsdharmalingam vinasithambytel: 60167225507 (malaysia)
COMPLAINT	i was onfe an icici bank customer( i closed my account and all credit cards in 2010 paid all dues and ended my relationship as my salary account was moved to citi bank and i don't need to maintain two accounts). from march 2016 icici bank is sendingÿcredit card account statements saying that i need to pay 84 rs in 2010 ( now 450 rs with late payment interest etc). contacted customer service. twice they created service requests and nothing happend. either my calls will be disconnected abruptly or placed in long hold. don't know what to do so i am posting here.
COMPLAINT	worst private bank i have ever seen : i am your customer since last 10 years and today i am really disappointed from your side. i have filed a complaint since may 25th 2016 regarding less money received from other bank atm. when i called your customer care officer i am always getting different time frame to resolve this issue. it seems now your bank is behaving like other government bank.below is the issue detail : i have done debit of 3000rs from kotak bank atm (relief road branch on dated 25th may 2016). at same time i got only 2600rs from that atm only. so i filed a complaint that i got 400rs less in this transaction.(complaint no sr415327787). after 1 week i got reply from your side that transaction was successful. at time of filing this complaint i already mentioned that please check cctv footage for the same. but its not done from your side. so i again filed complaint on dated june 1st 2016 but they didn?t provide me time frame to resolve this issue. so i called them on 9th june 2016now they told me that it will take total 17days to resolve this issue. so penitently wait for till date(june 20th 2016). today i called again to see status of my complaint again i got reply from your side that it will take 45 days. this is ridiculous. so i argue with customer care person and he again check and said now it will take 30 days to resolve this issue.i have never expected this type of careless service. to get only 400rs back i am wasting my time with your bank since 1 month. i have 2 accounts with your bank. one is saving and other is current account. now i am thinking to move both account with different bank as i think your service is degraded day by day...request you to solve my issue as soon as possible.

COMPLAINT	one of the worst service & response from honey park- surat branch. have been trying to change the mobile number for last 9 months. submitted an application to their branch for mobile number change on 9 september 2015. they said its done . even after several follow ups it was not done. then i came to ahmedabad for work. tried to change number online several times but its impossible to change as dont have the earlier number. tried all the methods online but all failed. so i again had to come from ahmedabad to surat to change number. when i went there they( mr rathod & staff) said that they dont know about old applications & asked me to file a new application . i even showed them( mr rathod & staff) the mail but still they showed no interest in earlier application. one lady even threatens to call police if i make any noise. this was so frustrating that it was almost unbearable. first they harass the customer & if the customer shows anger they threaten to call police. so again submitted another request in last week of june at their branch. they said its done. when i came to home & checked online to my horror it wasnt done. si i again took follow up the next day from mr rathod. he said me to give miscall on a another number to activate the number. i did the same. but it was not for number activation. but was for account balance check etc. i told him the same he told me to change mobile number through online banking. i tried & showed him that it was pending from their side. i took follow ups after follow ups. on whatsapp phone.etc. i even told the branch manager(mr anil) about the same. he simply told to wait & gave the phone to staff. now even after 7 days of visitng them again to their branch & after 9 months of filing the 1st application for mobile number change my number is still not changed. now they are saying to fill another application & send them the mail. i have already done this & waiting for their response.

COMPLAINT	hell today i got the call and talked with executive and social means executive now they are saying that in part payment we calculate value as per market base and release 65% loan it's wondering as now all bank provide 80 to 85% loan of home valueÿi need to inform you all people please make sure check all the details and terms and condition before taking loan because in last executive and bank will not responsible and we will suffering with our problem. they will just inform me check letter we cleared mentioned. i didn't understand till date while you evaluate first time of property and given section letter and i just request for part payment then the evaluate again property as per my think market value will same today after 10 or more day ofcourse market value will increase decrease is possible while recision it's a ridiculous and very very much bad experience with axis bank so please careful in any deal with axis bank.
COMPLAINT	am not at all surprised to see so many complains when i checked the axis bank fb page here. disgusting and annoying service of axis bank. have been trying to break an fd since more than a week with no progress which ideally should have been done in 1ÿworking day. and to top it up the branch(salt lakesector 3kolkata) employees have no idea why(and are on leave) !!! and each time a cse will mail me asking 2 more days. i swear to god this is the last transaction i want through axis. a bank that doesn't let you access your own money in an emergency is unworthy of trust specially in money matters.

COMPLAINT	n 19th january 2015 my father md irshad alam went to axis bank atm raja bazar to withdraw rs.5000 from his salary savings account. he withdrew rs.5000 and came out from the atm. he got a message on his registered mobile number that an amount of rs.5 000 has been debited from your account at 19:27. he received another message at 19:29 that an amount of rs.10000 has been debited from your account. however he did not perform any transaction. we have reported this incident to the axis bank kankurgachi branch garia branch and amherst street police station. but they are not at all taking any effective steps against this issue and simply wasting our time by telling that police will take care of these things. this incident is happening on a regular basis at axis bank keshab chandra street raja bazar atm.

COMPLIMENT	ÿprima facie it is for people who flies overseas quite frequently. even for such people the basket with 16 currencies is more than sufficient. another use of the card if i am not wrong this preloaded card works as hedge against exchange fluctuation.
COMPLIMENT	my family has another account for which they gave dso which is good about axis were others don't give such services but i cannot allow to take me for a ride... i will appreciate good service / any wrong doing will be severely condemned

SUGGESTION	here was a mail from the office of md and ceo asking for feedbback i spent almost 30 minutes higlhighting what needs to be done. there was not even an acknowledgement for the mail response of mine. here is the mail response pasting for all the other yes bank customers to read so that no other customer wastes his time responding to md & ceo office mail of yes bank: dear md and ceoi really feel sad when i receive this mail from you at a time when i cannot do mobile banking as mobile banking is not yet enabled for nri accounts.all indian banks ensure that the latest of the technology is available for nri accounts but in yes bank case they are totally unconcerned about nri customers and their accounts.worst part is when i access the website yesbank.in from a mobile smart phone such as iphone the browser doesnt get adjusted to the width of smartphone. basically bootstrapp enabled technology is not there for your website yesbank.intry accessing other bank websites such as icici and axis you will feel the difference.i would recommend you to benchmark your website against icici whose website is mobile enabled.you can check out axis whose website is not mobile enabled but atleast not cluttered when you access from mobile smartphone.i am not sure whether my feedback will be taken seriously but responding to the mail of teh office of ceo & mdlets see yesbank's response.warm regardsprem

COMPLAINT	i have a concern!i used my debit card to buy petrol. paid on 2nd july. all well done!! on 7th july i got a sms that rs. 63 is again debited by vendor as tips!!!when i called call center they say the vendor can debit more money based on last transaction without any authorisation by pin !!is that correct ? i asked the girl if the vendor can debit me any amount within my approved range and she said yes. i think the vendor (sidhivinayak petrol sector 6 nerul- god's name is used) is fleecing customers and you should stop the vendor and blacklist him. the call center has blocked my card - i don't know why !!please check complain ref - 23490820 and try save customers money. if the vendor is charging 3 to 4% from every customer as tips he must be making undue money big time !!
COMPLAINT	i am a customer of veera desai road branch (code 1704) have submitted sms alert deactivation request on 20-12-2014 & 20-02-2016. after that i have been charged repeatedly from 20-12-2016. have visited the branch 6/7 times but the staff is absolutelyÿuseless and have been saying each time that they will reverse the charges levied next week. it has been two years when that next week is going to come. i have acknowledgement of both the requests and will scan and put it on facebook soon. is there something called customer service @ axis bank veera desai branch ?
COMPLAINT	on june 27th 2016 i received a call from axis bank (+91-1409260063) offering a loan against my credit card. since i am already availing a loan from axis bank therefore i informed it to the calling axis bank representative asking am i still eligible to get a loan? to which the representative replied yes you are eligible for a loan of rs. 240000/-. on confirming my request for the same amount the representative told that the loan has been approved and it will be credited in my axis bank salary account within 2 days. on june 30 2016 i again called axis bank helpline (18002335577) asking about the loan status at 15:42 hours to which the attending axis bank representative confirmed me that my loan has been approved and it will be credited in my salary account within 2 working days.today it is july 8th 2016 and the amount has not yet been credited so i queried the axis bank help line (18002335577) at 21:55 hours asking about the loan's status to which the axis bank person named ajay told that it has been approved. on consistently asking why the amount is being delayed he made me wait for a long time and then informed as you are already availing a loan on your credit card so the approved loan has been cancelled. this is totally ridiculus and unprofessional approach of axis bank and i am taking it as an insult and harresment.

COMPLAINT	actually it looks like i am going to spend the final weeks of summer on hold waiting for someone to answer my call
COMPLAINT	dude i know right? every time i called this week (3 so far) its been 50-75 minutes waiting.
COMPLAINT	you should live the hell i've endured when their system was down for a week last year (?). i was a victim of fraud. tried verifying informationot and was given wrong information which led to more fraud all after sitting on hold repeatedly for long periods. 
SUGGESTION	try to deposit it into my bank of america account only to realize that literally every atm in a 30 mile radius is out of service. oh and mobile deposit too. then i'd switch banks.

LEAD	can i order for a bank of america credit card without having an account with you
REQUEST	hello i need to speak to a specialist the private facebook message link in my bofa app is not working for me.
REQUEST	mobile banking is not easier than before when i can't update to the new version (my iphone 4 can't run ios 8). the version i have worked just fine until the forced update came out.
REQUEST	a great way to simplify my life would be to take care of the issues i had getting help from a live person that i just posted about wrt to my atm card issue. don't expect everybody to know the amount of their last deposit and don't have some robot on the phone telling me a representative can't help me and refusing to connect me. i was almost late for my train dealing with this unexpected hassle today.
REQUEST	i don't want to throw the branch manager under the bus he was following procedure and trying to help. it's your procedures that are at fault not him. when i did get a person on the phone she fixed the problem and was also nice. the problem is that boa apparently cancelled my new atm card without asking or telling me because i waited to activate it till 1 day after my old one expired and then your manager was hampered by procedure and your phone rep i almost could not reach because a robot said multiple times your reps can't help with activation issues which is baloney obviously.
REQUEST	when using my atm in derry nh boa there was an on screen warning about a fee for making making savings withdrawals. it says to go online to boa facts about fees' and on the boa website proudly says ' ...'there are no fees for bank of america customers using one of thousands of bank of america atms in the united states to transfer funds make deposits inquire about a balance and withdraw cash.'.. please explain the two different statements
SUGGESTION	i like the app but that doesn't mean your customer service number needs to have 49 minute wait times. in my 20 years of being a loyal customer (and tax payer that helped bail out bofa when they made some seriously greedy decision that would have put them under) i am for the first time considering switching to a local community bank because their service is getting worse and worse. even in the branches things are going south. come on bofa you're posting good earnings - invest in your call centers.
SUGGESTION	thanks for reaching out. i emailed your customer service team. i can't be the only one that is wondering why calling customer service takes almost an hour thus i appreciate if you really do bring this up with your leadership team.
REQUEST	well no luck with contacting your bank via email.... they don't handle statement changes and i have to call in. not sure when i will have time to do that.
REQUEST	is there anyway to actually get a hold of customer service at this company? have been on hold for over an hour with no answer. i tried the app and web site but there is no way to connect or chat to get an issue resolved. why is there no access to customer service for customers? this is not acceptable service for a banking institution.
SUGGESTION	this is all nice and well how about setting an atm or branch location on the upper east side of manhattan. the nearest location is 86 and lexington avenue. further north is 125th street.
SUGGESTION	bring back the paste option i like secure password management.
SUGGESTION	it's wonderful how far you have come with mobile but the telephone service needs attention badly because the verbal system just isn't working well. i have been contacting you for several months now requesting you turn the keypad option back on for your customers that use the telephone banking option but no success thus far why? i don't know because i feel it is a very very easy fix. i called months ago and requested it and it was done instantly but in a few days they turned it back off so that logically tells me it is basically a flip of a switch as they say. your customers i am sure hate the new verbal system as much as i do for i have talked to several people about this and they all agree i have even talked to several bofa employees and they agree and can't understand why the keypad option was deleted. please return this option for the following reasons: #1 not private or secure everyone can hear you #2 very very slow #3 robot does not understand most commands # 4 takes 10 times more time and effort than the keypad takes. #5 who wants to speak out loud to a robot when you are in a waiting room & etc. #6 bank never sent customers a guideline or cheat sheet of terms the robot understands. all my requests thru email fb & twitter have been answered saying they would send on to the proper dept. but nothing is every done now (almost a year) how hard can this request be. oh yes by the way star 33 does not work either. thank you in advance for your kind help....i hope!!
COMPLAINT	i was thrilled to use the new app to report fraudulent activity! it was awesome to see i only had a 36(!) minute wait time. i need to find a bank who takes this stuff seriously
REQUEST	i like the new app but where are the cash back deals located? also is there any plans to open any branches in eastern kentucky?

COMPLAINT	dear kotak bank team i am a loyal customer of your bank since last many years. but recently i requested a new cheque book and the process you have for delivering the chequebook is really pathetic. it's not at all customer friendly. i am really frustrated. i requested the chequebook sometime in starting of apr and still i am struggling to get it. even the branch denied to handover it to me though they have it. i request you to take care of this issue urgently.
COMPLAINT	will mr. uday kotak look the apathy of credit card holder. if you are holding a kotak mahindra bank credit card and spent on some purchases after some time if the purchases found defective and you get the refund / cash back the kotak bank will not refund the same. they ask you to swipe. is it a good customer service. if the payments delayed by a day the kotak bank is smart enough to charge hefty interest whereas we are moving pillar to pillar and post to post to get our refund from kotak bank despite of providing bank details for refund... 09810007140; varuna152@yahoo.co
